# two-d6-3D
I wanted to learn some ThreeJS and CannonJS, so I decided to make my two-D6 roller more fancy ("fancy" is a stretch).

The way this works is that there is an off-screen box where the dice get thrown, their y-positions and rotations are copied to the two display dice.

Shown below is a table of results for many dice rolls. You can tell what the random distribution is.
